    <h2>Anthony John Hunter</h2>
    <em>(Words by his sister Kathryn Ann)</em>
    <p>Our brother Anthony was kind, intelligent, handsome, funny, a brave adventurer and very, very charming. He was the first born child; son of Herbert and Freda, brother to Kathryn, Richard  and Julia.
</p><p>
He was born in Macclesfield in the north of England  and spent his childhood in the Midlands - in Leicestershire, one of 4 children. We were lucky to have two loving parents and we remember our childhood as a happy family time with walks across fields and  happy Christmases.
</p><p>
Anthony was a clever school boy, good at rugby and gifted with languages. He wrote poetry, painted pictures, played the guitar, listened to music and embraced the swinging 60s. 
</p><p>
And he was loved by his family very much. 
</p><p>
But Anthony was very inquisitive, always wanting to understand the world and its people. He was a philosopher who loved to talk and was never happier than when he was talking to people about things he thought really mattered. He had a genuine interest in people and anyone who met him was left with a lasting impression that Anthony was a special person.
</p><p>
It wasn't enough for him to follow English traditions, get any job and do something which he found dull. He became restless and desperate for adventures. He wanted to meet people, tell stories and write his own story.
</p><p>
And there were 6 people living in a small house, so Anthony, at the age of 16 spread his wings and flew away to see the world.
</p><p>
He travelled around Europe coming home to England now and again but he made his home in Switzerland, where he worked hard and achieved well.
</p><p>
And in Switzerland he found love and he gave love to Lukas and Sascha. He was so very proud of his Swiss family and although it was a little unconventional so was Anthony! Anthony was a family man. It was clear that some of Anthony's happiest times were spent with Lukas and with  Sascha. He always had a story to tell about their lives and their achievements. It was very clear that he loved them unconditionally. 
</p><p>
In the last few years of his life  he seemed to find more peace in his home, Bruschhusli, with its beautiful view of the mountains and in simpler pleasures, like caring for Jessie, his donkey. Our family is so grateful to all the doctors and carers who tried to take away his pain and give him the time he needed. And even though the last few months were so difficult and painful for him  emotionally and physically, those who loved him had never seen him so strong.
</p><p>
We love our brother and we will miss him terribly.
</p><p>
But his life story has been amazing and we are so very proud of him.
