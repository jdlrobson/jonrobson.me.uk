## Hunter's and Gartsides

On my mother's side, I come from the Hunter and Gartside clan. Herbert **Hunter** (born 29th November 1912 in Ossett), died two years before I was born in March 1983 of a heart attack. He was a public health inspector.

[The Hunter family tree](https://jdlrobson.com/familytree/Frederick%20Hunter.html) is traced back only 3 generations.

He married Frieda **Gartside** (born 9th February 1926 in Holt). They lived in Macclesfield and later Leicester and Sheringham in Norfolk. Frieda would later die of lung cancer in January 1989 in Ashton-U-Lyme.

[The Gartside family tree](http://jdlrobson.com/familytree/Henry%20Gartside%201526.html) can be traced back to Henry Gartside in 1526.

Herbert and Frieda had four children - Anthony, Kathryn (my mother), Richard and Julia.
