    <h1>The Oxx's</h1>
    <h2>Mary Holder Oxx</h2>
    <p>Mary Holder Oxx, born August 1814 was the daughter of <a href="/family/oxx/john">John Oxx</a> and <strong>Woodhouse Spearman</strong>.</p>
    <p>She married <a href="/family/robson/robert">Robert Robson</a> with whom she had six children.</p>
    <p>The 1841 census has her working as a dress maker.</p>
    <p>She died in November 1876.</p>
    <p>Note: A Mary Oxx, widow, later married William Hull, widower Feb 8 1857 in the district of Newport, but given Robert Robson,
    her husband died in 1884, these are unlikely to be the same.</p>
