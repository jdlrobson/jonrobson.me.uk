    <h1>The Robson's</h1>
    <h2>Robert Robson</h2>
    <p>Son of <a href="/family/robson">John Robson</a> and <strong>Jane Watson</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Robert Robson</strong> was born on the 7th January 1820 in in Plessey, Newcastle, Northumberland, England (Plessey being an area of Stannington). The birth date given (of January 7th) was found on family tree passed down.</p>

<p>In 1842 (15th May), aged 22, he married <Link to='/family/oxx/maryholder/'>Mary Holder Oxx</Link>, a dress maker (aged 28). His marriage was registered in Newcastle on Tyne sup-registras district  to Mary Holder Oxx. They married at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Church,_Newcastle_upon_Tyne">All-Saints Church</a>.</p>

<p>They had six children. Their first child was born in 1843 <a href="/family/robson/johngeorge">John George Robson</a> (my great great grandfather). William Isaac (1845), Harriett Jane (1846), Hannah Mary Augusta (1849), Robert Amos (1851) and Frances Isabell Woodhouse (1854) followed.</p>

<p>During his life he worked as a roll turner (per his daughter Frances birth and marriage certificates and 1841 and 1861 censuses) in Middlesborough and later a mechanic at an engine works (1881 census).</p>

<p>Within the period of 1847-1850 he went to Nassau, Germany where he had his child <strong>Hannah Mary</strong>. The reason for this is unknown. In 1851 census he is shown to be living with wife Mary and children John George, William Isaac, Harriet Jane and <strong>Hannah Mary</strong>. Cooincidentally (??) he is living next door to another Robson - Joseph. He is living in Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>In 1854 his registered address was Rostock Terrace, Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>In 1877 he was living at 43 Guerney Street, Darlington.</p>

<p>The 1881 census has him as a 61 year old widow living with his daughter Hannah (now <strong>Bulmer</strong>) and her husband James at 40 Henry St, Darlington and 2 grandchildren working as a mechanic at engine works.</p>

<p>He died in June 1884.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, only <strong>John Robson</strong> (marrying Martha Lyall), <strong>Hannah Mary Augusta Robson</strong> (marrying <strong>James Bulmer</strong>) and <strong>Frances Isabell Woodhouse Robson</strong> (marrying Thomas Bellwood) went on to have children. <strong>Harriett Jane Robson</strong> married <strong>Thomas Hunter</strong> but I am not aware of any children.</p>
