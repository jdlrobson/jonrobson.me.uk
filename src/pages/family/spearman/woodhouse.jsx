    <h2>Woodhouse Spearman</h2>
    <p>Woodhouse was the daughter of <strong>Hannah Woodhouse</strong> and <a href="/family/spearman/george">George Spearman</a>. She was born in Newcastle in July 1787 (12.05pm - but I have lost the date!).</p>
    <p>Woodhouse married <a href="/family/oxx/john">John Oxx</a> at All Saints, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Northumberland, England with whom she had nine children.</p>
    <p>She died 5.30pm on 4th April 1826 aged 38 and was buried at St. Edmunds Burying Ground, Gateshead, letter F No. 6.
    I speculate that she died during the childbirth of her ninth son.</p>
